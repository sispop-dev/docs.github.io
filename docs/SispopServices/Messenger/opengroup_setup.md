# Session Open Group Setup

An express REST API for serving persistence history public chat rooms for Session. Open groups are not limited in size as they are hosted by your own server. Please be aware these are PUBLIC groups and sensitive private information should not be shared in this group format.

It's run by 2 daemons, the platform servers providing an ADN standard REST API and another with Session specific behaviors (crypto-key registration and enhanced moderation functions).

# Requirements
- Hosting with a public IP address
- make sure you have a working DNS hostname that points to your public IP address. 
- an email address (LetsEncrypt requires this)
- We recommend you have at least 4GB of free disk space and 512mb of ram (it may runs with less but use at your own risk)

# Installation

## 1. Install docker (debian)
for non-debian-based installation instructions of Docker: https://docs.docker.com/v17.12/install/#server

Use this guide for additional troubleshooting help: https://docs.docker.com/v17.12/install/linux/docker-ce/debian/#set-up-the-repository
or https://docs.docker.com/v17.12/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/

### Remove any possibly previously installed docker installations
`sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io`

### Install official docker repo
- `sudo apt-get update`
- `sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg2 software-properties-common`

#### For Debian
- `curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | sudo apt-key add -`
- `sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian $(lsb_release -cs) stable"`

#### For Ubuntu
- `curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -`
- `sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"`

### Install and test docker
- `apt-get update`
- `sudo apt-get install docker-ce`
- To check to make sure it's all working: `docker run hello-world`

## 2. Install docker-compose

### Create docker-compose script
`curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.25.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose`
### make sure it's executable
`chmod u+x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose`

## 3. Install SOGS
- `git clone https://github.com/sispop-dev/session-open-group-server.git`

### Install SOGS git submodules
- `cd session-open-group-server`
- `git submodule init`
- `git submodule update`

### Make sure permissions on acme.json is correct
`chmod 600 docker/acme.json`

### Set up config
- `cp sispop_template.ini sispop.ini`

### Make yourself an admin
- replace PUBKEY with your Session ID and run `echo "PUBKEY=true" >> sispop.ini`

### Start it
Replace `your@email.tld` with your email address and `yourssl.domain.tld` with your public facing hostname. These are required for getting an SSL certification from LetsEncrypt which we will attempt to automatically do for you.

`EMAIL=your@email.tld DOMAIN=yourssl.domain.tld docker-compose up -d`

# Upgrade instruction
- make sure you're in the `sispop-messenger-public-server` directory
- `EMAIL=your@email.tld DOMAIN=yourssl.domain.tld docker-compose down` to stop it from running
- `git pull` to grab the latest source and configs
- `git submodule init` to grab any submodule changes
- `git submodule update` to grab any platform/nodepomf changes
- `EMAIL=your@email.tld DOMAIN=yourssl.domain.tld docker-compose build` to update the local docker images
- `EMAIL=your@email.tld DOMAIN=yourssl.domain.tld docker-compose up -d` to restart the server
