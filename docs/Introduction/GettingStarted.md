## 1. Educate Yourself
Privacy is having the agency to decide when you reveal personal information. It is a particularly valuable quality today, when the collection and storage of personal data is taking place at unprecedented levels. We are in an age where data is of high value, and Sispop aims to equip individuals with tools to obfuscate their information and interactions with the internet. Protecting your data keeps power on your side.

Sispop's privacy tools offer free communication by incentivising individuals through its cryptocurrency block reward to keep the network private, secure and untraceable.

Before you start using Sispop, you should [educate yourself](../Introduction/SispopNetwork.md) about how Sispop will help you obfuscate your data.
