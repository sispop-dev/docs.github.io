## Information is Important

Privacy is having the agency to decide when you reveal personal information. It is a particularly valuable quality today, when the collection and storage of personal data is taking place at unprecedented levels in history.

Sispop provides the means to transact and communicate privately and anonymously, using the decentralised nature of blockchain technology to create new methods of interacting with the internet.

Sispop is a privacy cryptocurrency based on Monero. Sispop currently offers an incentivised full node layer, instant private transactions, and secure private communications.

More information on the project can be found on the [website](https://www.sispop.site/) and in the [whitepaper](https://sispop.site/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SispopWhitepaperV3_1.pdf).

Sispop is an open source project, and we encourage contributions from anyone with something to offer. For more information on contributing, please contact team@sispop.site
