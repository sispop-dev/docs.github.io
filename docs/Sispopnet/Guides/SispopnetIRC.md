# Hosting a SNApp
## 1. Downloading an IRC client

For this guide, we will be downloading and using the `konversation` IRC client.

Go into `Ubuntu Software` application and search for `konversation`.

Once found click the `install` button.

Once Konversation has been downloaded and installed you can then launch the software.

> **Note:** You must be running `sispopnet` to be able to access any IRC chats hosted on the Sispopnet.
> If you do not have `sispopnet` running, check out the installation guide [here](AccessingSNApps.md).

## 2. Connecting to a Sispopnet IRC

On first startup of Konversation a window will pop up with the heading `Server List`.

From this window, we will click the `New...` button.

Next to `Network name:` add the text `Sispopnet Chat`.

#### 2.1 Server details
In this window, underneath the `Servers:` section click the `Add...` button.

Copy and paste the following sispop address into servers: `irc.dw68y1xhptqbhcm5s8aaaip6dbopykagig5q5u1za4c7pzxto77y.sispop`

Leave `Port:` as `6667` and `Password:` blank.

This window should look similar to the below before clicking the `OK` button.

Click the `Add...` button underneith the `Auto Join Channels:` section.

In the `Channel:` section add the text `#sispopnet` and click the `OK` button.
