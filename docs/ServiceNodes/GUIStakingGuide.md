# GUI-Pool-Staking-Guide

This document will tell you exactly how to stake via the Sispop GUI wallet.

The latest version of the wallet can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/sispop-dev/sispop-electron-gui-wallet/releases).

Please keep in mind, one can **only stake via an open pool with the GUI wallet**. If you would like to stake your own node or a create pool, please view the full guide on service nodes [here](../SNFullGuide).

Also, this best done with a primary wallet address that is **not receiving mining transactions**. A separate primary wallet for Staking is recommended.

1) Open the wallet, enter your password, and let it fully sync to the latest blockheight.
