# Safely Receiving Sispop

In v5.1.2, the Daemon and Wallet have new fields added to indicate if
a transaction is backed by a checkpoint. This means that the transaction has
atleast 2 consecutive Service Node checkpoints proceeding it, meaning,
effectively the transaction can not be reorganised and hence can not be double
spent - once checkpointed.

## Changes

For sispopd in `get_info` we return a new field:
- `immutable_height - uint64`: The latest height in the blockchain that can not
  be reorganized from (backed by atleast 2 Service Node, or 1 hardcoded
  checkpoint, 0 if N/A).
```
{
  "status": "OK",
  "height": 234767,
  "target_height": 123,
  "immutable_height": 123,
  ...
}
```

For `sispop-wallet-rpc` in `get_transfers` we return a new field:
- `checkpointed - uint64`: If transfer is backed by atleast 2 Service Node
  Checkpoints, 0 if it is not, see `immutable_height` in the daemon rpc call
  `get_info`

For example, if you were requesting for incoming payments- the `checkpointed`
field would look like below.
```

### Command Line Interface

This new information is also exposed in the CLI wallet as well:

With `show_transfers`:
```

The changes to RPC are formally documented in our Sispop Documentation website (it
is currently being updated and will be shortly available).
- [WalletRPCBeta](https://docs.sispop.site/Developer/WalletRPCBeta/)
- [DaemonRPCBeta](https://docs.sispop.site/Developer/DaemonRPCBeta/)

The commit that introduced these changes, which also has some more ad-hoc
documentation (whilst Sispop Documentation is being updated) is available here
