# What is Cryptocurrency Mining?
Cryptocurrency Mining is the process of extracting Cryptocurrencies as a reward for securing and verifying transactions made on the blockchain.

Miners use computers to work on computational puzzles that change in difficulty depending on the number of miners on the network. The difficulty changes in order to enforce that the blocks are mined at similar time intervals, also known as the Block Generation Time. Each generated block provides a reward in the form of a predetermined amount of cryptocurrency to the individual or party who found the solution to the puzzle. This reward is commonly known as the [Block Reward](../Advanced/Cryptoeconomics.md) and is coded to reduce its emission over time.

## Mining Sispop

The Sispop cryptocurrency can be mined through the RandomX hashing algorithm.

## How to mine Sispop.

**Please note:** Unfortunately (because of some bad people using mining software in malware), most antivirus software will detect the programs below as unsafe.

It is **likely** you will need to add exceptions and exclusions to your antivirus software in order to make things work properly.

Unless you know what you are doing, please ***only*** download from the links below.

You can currently use [XMR-Stak](https://github.com/fireice-uk/xmr-stak) to mine Sispop.

### Mining Pools

A mining pool is a hub where a group of miners share their processing power to the network. The rewards are split equally based on the amount of hashing power each individual adds to the block. In the early days of Bitcoin mining it was viable to mine as an individual. However, because there now exists tens of thousands of miners it has become less viable to mine individually due to the share of each individual being minute compared to the overal hash of the network.

Sispop has a number of different mining pools to choose from:

| **Pool**                                         	| **Total Fee** 	| **Min. Payout (Sispop)** 	|
|--------------------------------------------------	|---------------	|------------------------	|
| [pool.sispop.site](https://pool.sispop.site/)| 0.8%            	| 50                   |

Mining Sispop in a mining pool requires the use of specific software such as XMR or XMRig.
